# The Problem

## Introduction

The European Center for Medium-Range Weather (ECMWF) forecasts provides global numeric weather predictions, serving both European member states and the (scientific) community at large. Additional data products include air quality analysis, ocean circulation analysis and hydrological predictions. The variety of services supports a broad range of applications, public services, agriculture, researches well as policy makers.

The ECMWF distributes their data products through a number of application programming interfaces (APIs). In particular the ECMWF WebAPI and for a subset of the products the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS). Currently, most of ECMWF focus is on python based solutions. Comprehensive post-processing routines and examples are therefore missing for the geo-spatial R community.

Here, we propose to collaboratively develop a comprehensive set of routines focussed on the ECMWF data products and their diverse user community.
